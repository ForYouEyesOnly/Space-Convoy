# Space-Convoy
The code framework which will model and simulate a swarm of vehicles showing default behav- iours which keep them in motion, together as well as collision-free is provided to you. All vehi- cles have a local “charge” to keep them “alive”. For physical reasons yet unknown, the vehicles replenish their charge to full by passing “energy globes” in close proximity. Vehicles which run out of charge mysteriously disappear. Vehicles constantly consume a little bit of energy to keep their on-board systems running, and consume more substantial amounts of energy when accelerating or decelerating.
